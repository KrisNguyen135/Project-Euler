    "# Project Euler Problem 118:<br><i>Totient chains</i>\n",

    "Link to original problem prompt: [https://projecteuler.net/problem=214](https://projecteuler.net/problem=214)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My solution for this problem was quite straightforward: to calculate the totient function of all numbers below the largest prime number less than 40,000,000. After that calculation, we can then loop through all the primes and see which of them will produce chains of length 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculation of the totient function\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick search on Google will yield the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(n) = n\\ (1 - \\frac{1}{p_1})\\ (1 - \\frac{1}{p_2})\\ ... (1 - \\frac{1}{p_k})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the prime factorization of $n$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n = p_1^{a_1}\\ p_2^{a_2}\\ ... p_k^{a_k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So to calculate the totient function of a given $n$, we only have to find all prime factors of $n$. This contitutes finding all prime numbers below the limit 40,000,000, finding which prime numbers are factors of which numbers, and finally, applying the above formula to calculate the actual totient function. All of this can be done via sieves:"

    "## Threading and queuing\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed in the Python functions above that I am taking advantage of the `threading` and `queue` modules to loop through and process a large amount of numbers. Specifically, I typically have a queue holding a list of tasks (numbers to be processed) and a fixed number of threads (or even processes via the `multiprocessing` module in Python) to interact with that queue and cooperatively process the tasks together. This technique can significantly improves the execution time of our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If interested, you can check out my book _Mastering Concurrency in Python_ on [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-concurrency-python) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1789343054) to find out other concurrency techniques that can be leveraged in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "My solution feels somewhat similar to a brute-force approach, only usable because of the application of concurrency. Therefore I'm sure there are better solutions out there. Nonetheless, it is rare for me to be able to apply concurrency to Project Euler problems so I'm happy with my solution."
