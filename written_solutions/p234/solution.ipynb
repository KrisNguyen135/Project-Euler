    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Some might be tempted to loop through all integers not exceeding 999966663333 and check to see if each is semidivisible or not (by computing its _lower prime square root_ and _upper prime square root_). A faster approach relies on the fact that given two consecutive prime numbers, it is possible to work out all semidivisible numbers between them, and finally compute their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semidivisible numbers between two consecutive prime numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $p$ and $q$ are two consecutive prime numbers, we see that every integer $n$ such that $p < n < q$ have the same lower prime square root (specifically $p$) and also the same upper prime square root (specifically $q$). This means that if we divide our search space into sections between pairs of consecutive prime numbers, we can exhaust all semidivisible numbers in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal now is,  given $p$ and $q$, to calculate the sum of all semidivisible numbers between them. This is simply the sum of all numbers divisible by $p$ or $q$ but not by $p$ and $q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, if $n$ is divisible by both $p$ and $q$, it is also divisible by $p * q$. The question is now reduced to an algorithm that computes the sum of all multiples of a given integer $p$ inside a specific range.\n",

    "& = p * (n\\ +\\ (n + 1)\\ +\\ ...\\ +\\ m)\\\\\n",
    "& = p * [(1\\ + 2\\ +\\ ...\\ +\\ m) - (1\\ + 2\\ +\\ ...\\ +\\ n)]\\\\\n",
    "& = p * [\\frac{m * (m + 1)}{2} - \\frac{n * (n + 1)}{2})]\n",
